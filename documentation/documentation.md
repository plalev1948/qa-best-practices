There are so many types of software testing – automated and manual, exploratory and functional, compatibility, UI/UX,  regression, unit, API, and performance testing.What is common for all these types, however, is that each requires you to write thorough QA testing documentation.

Test Plan:

The test plan is a guiding document which outlines the bigger picture of the QA process, and includes a to-do list, strategy, resources, and schedule. It should answer the questions “What features need to be tested?” and “What is the purpose of the software solution?”. Before starting the testing process you need to decide what methodologies, technologies, and tools you will use.

The test plan will help you understand the following:

* What are the acceptance criteria?
* What resources do you need? What operating systems, how many copies, and  with what license? Do you need any technical consultants?
* Are your roles and responsibilities well-designated?
* What are testing timeframes?

Test Progress Report:

The test progress report is another part of the QA documentation, which is similar to the test plan but with added data on the current progress. This document lets you and your development team monitor project progress and identify organizational issues, if any.
